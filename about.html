<p> This website is mainly about exposing and talking about fake news thats being spread around the whole of social media
 so people can believe what is being told to them. We are here so we can prevent that from happening and try and make a change with social media fake news.
Fake News can lead to many bad things thats why we are working so hard to make sure whatever fake news we see go through, gets exposed. We also have this website
so we are able to give you guys tips on how to realise if it's fake news or real news. We are here to keep everyone safe from the fake news before it becomes something serious.
We also make sure we give out knowledge to the younger children growing up so they know what to do when something like this happens in the future.

<h1 class-"heading">How do we want to help you guys out?</h1>
<p><img src="images/communicating.jpg" alt="Previous News Image" /></p>
<p>For us to help you guys out, we plan to have our own online lessons which will be totally free
so it can allow anyone to participate so they are able to follow what we know about fake news and what they should avoid.
We think it's better to have a online lesson so whenever someone wants to ask a question, they are free to ask so we can help them
out as much as possible. We feel like this is important so all the people who want to get involved in the lesson, can give out there opinions
about fake news and because we are able to communicate with you guys so we know how you feel. We feel like this is the best way so we can
grow as a group and rise against fake news so it wont be able to cause us problems in the future.
