<p>There has been more fake news travelling across social media even on the newspapers which is freaking everybody out and is making them panic.
There has been news talking about an apocalypse is going to happen because of an explosion that is polutting the air and it is causing animals, insects etc to mutate
and turn into viruses and infected animals. This is causing people to move out of there houses, fly out to different courntries so they make sure they are fine.
This is all just FAKE NEWS. There is not going to be an apocalypse and the world will be fine and will be normal. There is no need to run out of town or escape the country.
You are all safe there will be no apocalypse. This is just social media trying to cause a panic in the world.
